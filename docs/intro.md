## What are Modular Components

Modular Components are React components built through a modular factory, allowing to
add functionality as needed as the component is built.

The modular factory approach is built on top of React hooks, and offers out-of-the-box
composition for building and stub injections for testing.

It offers best-in-class DX through strong typing and easy separation of concern, and is
infinitely extensible thanks to its built-in modular nature.

You can think of it as "higher-order hooks", without the awkward chaining of methods
thanks to the factory pattern.

## Installation

At it simplest, you will need the `@modular-component/core` package to get started with `ModularComponent`.

However, the core module alone does not bring any component capability - it needs plugins,
or extensions, to start shining ✨

We provide a sensible set of default capabilities through the `@modular-component/default` package.
It is highly recommended to install both for getting started.

```sh
yarn add @modular-component/core @modular-component/default
```

You can then build your component factory by combining the `modularFactory` export from
`@modular-component/core`, and the default set of stages exported as `WithDefaultStages`
from `@modular-component/default`.

```tsx
import { modularFactory } from '@modular-component/core'
import { WithDefaultStages } from '@modular-component/default'

const ModularComponent = modularFactory.extend(WithDefaultStages).build()
```

You can then instantiate new components with the `ModularComponent` factory function:

```tsx
const MyFirstModularComponent = ModularComponent<{
  someFlag?: boolean
  someLabel: string
  someValue: number
}>()
  .withDefaultProps({ someFlag: false })
  .withLifecycle(({ props }) => {
    const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0)

    return { someState }
  })
  .withRender(({ props, lifecycle }) => (
    <>
      <h2>
        {props.someLabel}: {props.someValue}
      </h2>
      <p>Value from state: {lifecycle.someState}</p>
      <p>Flag from props: {props.someFlag ? 'true' : 'false'}</p>
    </>
  ))
```

## How it works

### The factory pipeline

#### Pipeline stages

The main concept behind the `ModularComponent` approach is the factory pipeline.

At its core, a `ModularComponent` is a set of ordered **stages**, each of which populates
a specific **argument** in a shared object, which gets passed from stage to stage.

The last stage (usually, but not necessarily, the **render stage**) has therefore access
to data computed by every previous stage in the pipeline.

This allows for instance to separate any stateful lifecycle computation in a dedicated
stage, and keep the render stage for its main purpose: laying down the markup through JSX.

Here is the "getting started" example, complete with comments explaining
the pipeline system:

```tsx
import { ModularComponent } from '@modular-component/core'

const MyFirstModularComponent = ModularComponent<{
  someFlag?: boolean
  someLabel: string
  someValue: number
}>()
  // .withDefaultProps modifies the `props` argument to mark
  // provided props as NonNullable. Here, `someFlag` will be
  // a `boolean` for all further stages, instead of `boolean | undefined`
  // as it originally was
  .withDefaultProps({ someFlag: false })
  // .withLifecycle receives the modified props from .withDefaultProps
  // It then uses React hooks to construct our component's internal state
  .withLifecycle(({ props }) => {
    const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0)

    return { someState }
  })
  // Finally, .withRender receives both the up-to-date props and the new
  // lifecycle argument generated by the .withLifecycle stage
  .withRender(({ props, lifecycle }) => (
    <>
      <h2>
        {props.someLabel}: {props.someValue}
      </h2>
      <p>Value from state: {lifecycle.someState}</p>
      <p>Flag from props: {props.someFlag ? 'true' : 'false'}</p>
    </>
  ))
```

#### Stages modes

Each stage can be called multiple time, but the way subsequent calls to the
same stage are handled depends on its **mode**.

Stages can have one of two modes: **single** (default), or **multiple**.

- A **single**-mode stage can only be inserted once in a pipeline. Further calls
  to the same stage function will replace the implementation of the stage but keep its
  position in the pipeline.

  Because of this, it's important that the provided argument honors the contract
  set up by the very first call, otherwise it could break stages depending on it.

  When using TypeScript, this is enforced internally, and a subsequent call to an already
  added stages will be narrowed to force honoring previous contracts.

- A **multiple**-mode stage on the other hand can appear in various places in the pipeline.

  Further calls to the stage function will simply add new stages to the pipeline, modifying the
  generated value only for further stages down the pipeline.

  Since calls are never modified, further calls can completely change the value of the field
  without any impact on previous stages. For the same reason, the TypeScript definition is not
  restricted in any way.

The reason for the **single** mode being default is to help re-usability: for instance, you can
extend an existing component by replacing its lifecycle but keeping the same render, of vice-versa.

This also makes `ModularComponent`s easy to test: stages can be tested in isolation from one another.

### Other methods

Atop of the factory stages configured through extensions, `ModularComponent`s
also expose two more methods:

- `asHook`: extract the stages as a custom hook, returning the map of arguments.
  This is used internally when calling the generated component, but can also be
  useful in other situations like tests, or the need to generate a shared hook
  consuming application context, such as a global store for which a stage exists.

  It optionally takes a string parameter allowing to extract a specific argument.

- `atStage`: rewinds a factory all the way up to a specific stage
  (in case on multiple-mode stages, the last occurrence is used), and return the
  a new `ModularComponent` with the remaining stages.
  Useful for instance to test in isolation the first few stages of a component.

Combining those two methods can be very powerful in testing scenarios. For instance,
one can extract the lifecycle hook of a component by chaining them:

```tsx
const useLifecycle = MyComponent.atStage('withLifecycle').asHook('lifecycle')
```
