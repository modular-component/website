## What are Modular Components

Modular Components are React components built through a modular factory, allowing the
addition of functionality as needed as the component is built.

The modular factory approach is built on top of React hooks, and offers out-of-the-box
composition for building and stub injections for testing.

It offers best-in-class DX through strong typing and easy separation of concern, and is
infinitely extensible thanks to its built-in modular nature.

You can think of it as "higher-order hooks", without the awkward chaining of methods
thanks to the factory pattern.

## Installation

At it simplest, you will need the `@modular-component/core` package to get started with `ModularComponent`.

However, the core module alone does not bring any component capability - it needs plugins,
or extensions, to start shining ✨ !

We provide a sensible set of default capabilities through the `@modular-component/default` package.
It is highly recommended to install both for getting started.

```sh
yarn add @modular-component/core @modular-component/default
```

You can then build your components using the `ModularComponent` factory exported from `@modular-component/core`,
and the default set of stages exported from `@modular-component/default`.

```tsx
import { ModularComponent } from '@modular-component/core'
import * as Stage from '@modular-component/default'

const MyFirstModularComponent = ModularComponent<{
  someFlag?: boolean
  someLabel: string
  someValue: number
}>()
  .with(Stage.defaultProps({ someFlag: false }))
  .with(Stage.lifecycle(({ props }) => {
    const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0)

    return { someState }
  }))
  .with(Stage.render(({ props, lifecycle }) => (
    <>
      <h2>
        {props.someLabel}: {props.someValue}
      </h2>
      <p>Value from state: {lifecycle.someState}</p>
      <p>Flag from props: {props.someFlag ? 'true' : 'false'}</p>
    </>
  )))
```

## How it works

### The factory pipeline

#### Pipeline stages

The main concept behind the `ModularComponent` approach is the factory pipeline.

At its core, a `ModularComponent` is a set of ordered **stages**, each of which populates
a specific **argument** in a shared object, which gets passed from stage to stage.

The last stage (the **render** stage) has therefore access
to data computed by every previous stage in the pipeline.

This for instance allows separating any stateful lifecycle computation in a dedicated
stage, and keep the render stage for its main purpose: laying down the markup through JSX.

Here is the "getting started" example, complete with comments explaining
the pipeline system:

```tsx
import { ModularComponent } from '@modular-component/core'
import * as Stage from '@modular-component/default'

const MyFirstModularComponent = ModularComponent<{
  someFlag?: boolean
  someLabel: string
  someValue: number
}>()
  // .with(defaultProps) modifies the `props` argument to mark
  // provided props as NonNullable. Here, `someFlag` will be
  // a `boolean` for all downstream stages, instead of `boolean | undefined`
  // as it originally was
  .with(Stage.defaultProps({ someFlag: false }))
  // .with(lifecycle) receives the modified props from .with(defaultProps)
  // It then uses React hooks to construct our component's internal state
  .with(Stage.lifecycle(({ props }) => {
    const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0)

    return { someState }
  }))
  // Finally, .with(render) receives both the up-to-date props and the new
  // lifecycle argument generated by the .with(lifecycle) stage
  .with(render(({ props, lifecycle }) => (
    <>
      <h2>
        {props.someLabel}: {props.someValue}
      </h2>
      <p>Value from state: {lifecycle.someState}</p>
      <p>Flag from props: {props.someFlag ? 'true' : 'false'}</p>
    </>
  )))
```

#### Adding stages

You can keep on chaining `.with` calls as much as you want to add more stages. However, a given field can only be set once:
calling `.with` again with a different payload for the same field will replace the initial stage set for that field.

Internally, a `ModularComponent` keeps an array of ordered stages. Calling the `.with`
method will either append a new stage to the array, or edit an already existing value.

When using TypeScript, the compiler will tell you if a subsequent call to `.with` with an existing field causes
a conflict with the previous value, to ensure coherence between stages.

:::info TypeScript: Forcing a new value on a field
If you are using TypeScript and want to override a field completely without backwards compatibility with its previous
value (for instance if you know you will be editing all stages depending on the field too), you can replace `.with`
with `.force`, which does the same internally but bypasses the type checking.

### Generating hooks

By default, if a **render** stage is not provided in your pipeline, `ModularComponent` will inject one on your behalf
that returns `null`, so that your component stays renderable.

But you can also opt to skip the render step entirely, turning your `ModularComponent` into a hook.

Simply append `use()` at the end of your chain to enable this feature:

```tsx
const useModularHook = ModularComponent()
  .with(Stage.lifecycle(() => {
    const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(false)
    const toggleOn = React.useCallback(() => setEnabled(true), [])
    const toggleOff = React.useCallback(() => setEnabled(false), [])
    return { enabled, toggleOn, toggleOff }
  }))
  .use()

// ...
const { lifecycle } = useModularHook()

lifecycle.toggleOn()
lifecycle.enabled
```

You can also pass the name of an argument field to the `use()` method to isolate this specific stage. 
Stages downstream to the stage generating the argument will be skipped, and the return value will be
scoped to the selected field:

```tsx
const useIsolatedStage = ModularComponent()
  .with(Stage.lifecycle(() => {
    const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(false)
    const toggleOn = React.useCallback(() => setEnabled(true), [])
    const toggleOff = React.useCallback(() => setEnabled(false), [])
    return { enabled, toggleOn, toggleOff }
  }))
  .use('lifecycle')

// ...
const { toggleOn, toggleOff, enabled } = useIsolatedStage()
```

### Other methods

#### Isolating a stage

For testing purposes, you might want to extract a stage function to be able to unit-test it in isolation. You can
use the `stage()` method to achieve just that.

`stage()` takes things a step further than `use()`, and should really only be used for testing purposes. It always takes
a field name to isolate, and returns a hook that takes the arguments map as parameter rather than the component props.

When using `stage()`, you are responsible for providing the relevant arguments expected by your stage function to work.
Its only use-case is for testing purposes where you want to finely control each input and check the output.

#### Setting the component's `displayName`

Since the actual component function is created inside the factory, React cannot infer its display name from your
variable name. If you want to set a display name for debugging purposes, you have several ways:

1. Simply set the `displayName` property on your generated component, like any other React component:
   ```tsx
   const MyComponent = ModularComponent()
    .with(...)
   
   MyComponent.displayName = 'MyComponent'
   ```
2. Pass your display name as first and only parameter to the initial `ModularComponent` call:
   ```tsx
   const MyComponent = ModularComponent('MyComponent')
    .with(...)
   ```
3. Call `setDisplayName` somewhere in your pipeline:
   ```tsx
   const MyComponent = ModularComponent()
    .setDisplayName('MyComponent')
    .with(...)
   ```
