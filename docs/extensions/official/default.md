# @modular-component/default

Set of sensible defaults for using `ModularComponent`. 

Provides two stages: `withLifecycle` for adding a lifecycle hook, and `withDefaultProps` for
providing default values for props.

It's also possible to import each of them individually through `@modular-component/with-lifecycle`
and <br /> `@modular-component/with-default-props` respectively.
