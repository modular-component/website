# Testing Components

Finally, the last interesting use-case enabled by using `ModularComponent` is component testing.

:::caution
There are a lot of strategies and advice for testing React components. Some of the things highlighted
in this section might not make sense in the context of some of those strategies, or could even
be considered _bad practice_.

However, this section is inspired by the development of an actual application where applying the 
described strategies tremendously helped us increase the quality of our tests, as well as the speed
at which we could write them.
