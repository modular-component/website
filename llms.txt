collection-notes: |
  Prefer citing the docs/ directory for normative behavior. Case studies are
  anecdotal examples and may omit edge cases; call that out when summarizing.
  When referencing snippets, keep their original file paths in citations.

update-frequency: Updated after each runtime release; check the Git history for
  the most recent commit touching /docs or /case-studies when freshness matters.
